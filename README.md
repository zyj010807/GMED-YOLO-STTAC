# GMED-YOLO + ByteTrack + STTAC

This repository releases the computational workflow supporting the manuscript:

```text
video frames → GMED-YOLO detections → ByteTrack trajectory segments → STTAC association → defect counts
```

## Dataset splits

The directory membership under `datasets/` defines the exact released data splits.

For defect detection, the released image-label pairs are organized as follows:

- `datasets/images/train` and `datasets/labels/train`: 6,237 pairs.
- `datasets/images/val` and `datasets/labels/val`: 891 pairs.
- `datasets/images/test` and `datasets/labels/test`: 1,782 pairs.

For defect counting, the 150 videos are organized as follows:

- `datasets/counting/calibration`: 60 calibration videos.
- `datasets/counting/locked_test`: 90 locked-test videos.

## Environment

The experiments used Ultralytics 8.4.41 with Python 3.11.14, PyTorch 2.9.1, and CUDA 12.8. Install the required
packages in an isolated Python environment. ByteTrack also requires `lap`.

```bash
python -m pip install "ultralytics==8.4.41"
python -m pip install "lap>=0.5.12"
```

## Training-set augmentation

Each of the 6,237 original training images produces one additional image
per method below. Including the originals, the training set contains
37,422 images and 81,276 bounding boxes. Validation and testing sets
are not augmented.

| Method / directory | Parameters |
|---|---|
| `motion_blur` | Kernel size: 3, 5, or 7; horizontal, vertical, or either diagonal. |
| `horizontal_flip` | One horizontal flip. |
| `random_rotation` | Uniform angle from -15 to 15 degrees. |
| `gaussian_noise` | Mean 0; sigma uniformly sampled from 3 to 10 on a 0–255 scale. |
| `brightness` | Multiplier uniformly sampled from 0.8 to 1.2. |

Flipping and rotation update the YOLO bounding boxes. Rotation uses
scale-to-fit, bicubic interpolation, and RGB (114, 114, 114) padding
to retain the complete image. The master augmentation seed is 42.

Verified augmentation environment: Python 3.13.9, NumPy 2.4.6, Pillow 12.2.0.
Run the following commands in that environment from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install "numpy==2.4.6" "Pillow==12.2.0"
python augment_train.py
```

Outputs are saved to `datasets/images/train_augmented/<method>/`
and `datasets/labels/train_augmented/<method>/`, using filenames
`<original_id>__<method>.png` and `<original_id>__<method>.txt`.
Existing augmentation directories are not overwritten.

To train on the combined dataset, the `train` setting in
`configs/apple-defect.yaml` must include the original training directory
and all five augmentation directories.

## Detector training

The released training settings are an input size of 640 pixels, 200 epochs, batch size 16, SGD, an initial learning
rate of 0.01, momentum of 0.937, and weight decay of 0.0005. All detector models are trained from scratch without
pretrained weights. The five random seeds are listed in `seeds.txt`.

Before training, set `path` in `configs/apple-defect.yaml` to the absolute path of the repository's `datasets`
directory.

```bash
python train_gmed_yolo.py --config configs/train.yaml
```

## ByteTrack trajectory generation

Trajectory generation uses the ByteTrack implementation bundled with Ultralytics 8.4.41. The exact tracker
parameters are provided in `configs/bytetrack.yaml`.

```bash
python postprocess.py \
  --weights /path/to/best.pt \
  --source /path/to/input.avi \
  --output-dir runs/track/sample
```

## STTAC counting

```bash
python sttac_count.py \
  --input runs/track/sample/input_trajectories.csv \
  --output runs/track/sample/input_sttac_counts.csv
```

The default STTAC parameters are `L_min=5`, `alpha=0.1`, `N_roller=120 rpm`, `R_roller=25 mm`,
`R_apple=40.25 mm`, `s=0.144`, `F=90.1 FPS`, `delta=15 frames`, and `Delta_y_th=20 pixels`. They give
`N_half=42` and the inclusive temporal window `[27, 57]` frames. Counting uses the three defect classes `puncture`,
`bruise`, and `bitter pit`.
